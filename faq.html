    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <p><b>How do I book an appointment?:</b> Through emailing me at maxmotocarellc@gmail.com. Make sure to send your home address, first and last name, phone number, year, make, model, trim of your vehicle, and the services you'd like to get done. I will reply with an estimate and an estimated time of completion for the services. Once I've confirmed everything with the customer and ordered parts, refunds are not available.  
    <p><b>Where are services performed?:</b>Right in my garage to ensure your vehicles' safety, to comply with HOA, and to keep your driveway clean. I use absorbent mats in my garage to ensure no environmental hazards</p>
    <p><b>Where are the old parts/oil disposed of?:</b>All parts/oil are disposed of through government-approved Hazardous Waste Centers to ensure environmental safety</p>
    <p><b>Payment policy:</b>Once parts are ordered, refunds are not available. I will confirm and finalize the estimate with you before anything is ordered</p>
